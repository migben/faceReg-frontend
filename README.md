# faceReg-frontend

This is a react application that identifies the faces from images. I also implemented login/signout and register forms with validations.
This was one of the first react web app I ever made and will always be proud of it. 

âš  **warning:** The app may take a little while to launch on Heroku.

## Demo & Code
